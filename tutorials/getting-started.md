# Getting Started with Shopr

This series of tutorials will guide you through building an entire (albeit basic) store
using Shopr. It will cover getting up and running, displaying your catalog as well as
the whole order flow process.

In this tutorial, we're going to set up Shopr from scratch into a brand new 
Rails application. We're assuming that you have Rails, Ruby, RubyGems & Bundler
installed at their latest versions. This guide was produced using Rails 4.0.1 & Ruby 2.0.

During this tutorial, we will execute commands such as `rails` or `rake`. You may find
you need to prefix these commands with `bundle exec` depending on your local system
setup.

* [Setting up Shopr](setting-up)
* [Displaying your product catalog](products)
* [Customer baskets](baskets)
* [Checking out](checking-out)

The final application built in this tutorial is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/tryshopr/getting-started-tutorial).
If you get stuck or need further information, this would be an excellent place to
download a working copy of the application.
